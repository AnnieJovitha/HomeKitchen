This is a [benparsell.com](https://benparsell.com) project bootstrapped with [`next.js`](https://nextjs.org/). I've decided to open source the primary source code, where this relies on a MongoDB backend to replicate recipes. The plan is to expand beyond just HelloFresh recipes into other sites like BudgetBytes, etc. In order to do so, I'll need to write additional API connectors or web scrapers to help in pulling that information down, and saving into a standardized schema in MongoDB.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
